<h3 id="c2">Tricks of the trade:</h3>
<h4>BASIC DIRECTIONS</h4>
<p><i>Step 1:</i> Remove cross bar from bottom of
hairpin lace loom. Loom is held with round
end up (or remaining bar up if adjustable
loom). Form a slip loop &frac12; the width of loom,
place left prong through loop (illustration #1),
replace cross bar.</p>
<p><i>Step 2:</i> Pass yarn around right side of loom
and across back ([illustration #2]), insert
crochet hook in loop and pull until knot is at
center, pick up yarn and pull through loop
(illustration #3), remove hook from loop.</p>
<p><i>Step 3:</i> Insert hook in dropped loop from
back (illustration #4) turn loom toward
you from right to left, passing yarn around
back of loom, chain 1 (illustration #5) sc
in front loop to left of center sts, (illustration #6)
drop loop from hook.</p>
<p>(Note: If easier for you, do not drop hook
from loop before turning, but pass shank of
crochet hook through to back of loom and
then turn and proceed as in step 3 after turn.)</p>

<p class="pcap">STEP 1 &middot; STEP 2 &middot; STEP 3 &middot; STEP 4 &middot; STEP 5 &middot; STEP 6</p>
</div>
<p>KEEPING TWIST: To keep twist in loops,
insert crochet hook from back to front in
loops, then follow directions given.</p>
<p>WORKING LOOPS STRAIGHT: Insert
crochet hook from front to back in loops,
then follow directions given.</p>
<h4>PREVENTING SLANT:</h4>
<p>When joining strips they sometimes have a
tendency to ride uphill or to one side. We
therefore suggest the following method of
joining. Alternating from strip to strip, with
starting end always on the right, insert hook
in 2 right loops of 1st strip and pull through
1st 2 left loops of 2nd strip, then 2 loops on
1st strip, etc. until all loops are joined. Fasten
off.</p>
<p>Insert crochet hook in 2 left loops of 3rd
strip, pull 2 right loops of 2nd strip through,
etc.</p>
<p>Insert hook in 2 right loops of 3rd strip, pull
through 2 left loops of 4th strip, then 2 loops
of 3rd strip, etc.</p>
<p>Insert hook in 2 left loops of 5th strip, pull
through 2 right loops of 4th strip, then 2
loops of 5th strip. Finish all last loops by
pulling remaining length at center of strip
through last loop, bring end back to center
and work back through several sts at center.
Conceal all ends.</p>
<p>COUNTING LOOPS: There must always
be same number of loops on EACH side of
loom. When a large number of loops are required
use a SUSAN BATES&#174; marker to
mark the 50th or the 100th loop on each
side, then count from marker. This will be a
time saver.</p>
<p>FULL LOOM: Remove cross bar, slip all
but 3 or 4 loops off loom. Replace bar and
roll loops up; secure with SUSAN BATES&#174;
4&frac12; inch stitch holder to back of work to
prevent stretching of loops while continuing
strip.</p>
<p>GAUGE: Measure the stitches at center of
loom; if you get more stitches than called
for, change to a larger crochet hook; if you
get less stitches than called for, change to a
smaller hook.</p>

<dt>MARCIA LYNN&#174;</dt>
<dt>3-inch Hairpin Lace loom</dt>

<dd class="t2">or colors of your choice</dd></dl>
<p>Yarn is used double. Each loop has two
strands of yarn but is still called a single
loop.</p>
<p>Edgings on both afghan and pillow are
made on a 3-inch loom, even though the
afghan is made on a 4-inch.</p>
<p>AFGHAN: With 4-inch loom and J-10 crochet
hook, make strips of 130 lps each on
each side of loom as follows: 6-purple, 7-blue,
12-white.</p>
<p>To join: Starting with blue strip, join to
white strip (as per instructions below), then
join to purple strip, then to white ... continue
thus for length of afghan, ending with
blue strip.</p>
<p>Join loops by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps,
always starting at the same end. When all
strips are joined, weave in all ends, and finish
as follows. Finish sides of afghan by
pulling 2 lps through 2 lps. Fasten last 2
lps securely. Attach double yarn at corner,
and working along ends, sc in corner, * ch
2, sc in next lp. Repeat from * across, ending
ch 2, sc in corner st. Ch 1, turn.</p>
<p>ROW 2: Sc in first st. Then work * 2 sc in
ch 2 space, sc in next sc. Repeat from *
across. Fasten off. Work other end of afghan
the same way.</p>
<p>EDGING: With purple yarn and 3-inch
crochet loom, and working on one side of
loom, make 2 strips each of 200 lps, and 2
each of 150 lps.</p>
<p>To Make Edging: Edging is worked in the
same way as regular strips, but instead of
working the single crochet down the center
of the loom, it is worked close to one prong.
This will make the loops on one side of
strip longer than the other. With J-10 crochet
hook, and working on smallest loops,
pull 2 lps through 2 lps all the way across
each strip. If you prefer, the long loop may
be cut for a fringe effect.</p>
<p>Sew the longer strips to the sides, and
the shorter ones to the ends, easing them
around the corners, keeping them flat.</p>
<h3 id="c6">PILLOW:</h3>
<p>Make 18 strips each of 42 lps each side as
follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">6&mdash;blue</p>
<p class="t0">4&mdash;purple</p>
<p class="t0">8&mdash;white</p>
</div>
<p>Join by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps as follows:
Starting with blue strip continue with
white, purple, white, blue, white, purple,
white, blue, blue, white, purple, white,
blue, white, purple, white, blue. When all
strips have been joined, join the first strip
to the last. Weave in all ends. Slip pillow
form in and sew both ends.</p>
<p>EDGING: With purple yarn and 3-inch
crochet loom and working on one side of
loom, make a strip of approximately 200 lps,
or enough to go around pillow. Finish short
loops by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps, and sew
to pillow.</p>

<p>Gauge: 3 sc = 1 inch at center of strip.</p>
<p>Yarn is used double. Each loop has two
strands of yarn but is still called a single
loop.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>TAM: Make hairpin lace strips as follows:</dt>
<dd class="t2">1 strip of 30 loops</dd>
<dd class="t2">2 strips of 60 loops</dd>
<dd class="t2">2 strips of 90 loops</dd></dl>
<p>FIRST STRIP (30 lps): Thread a piece of
yarn through all loops on one side of strip
and tie yarn tightly forming a circle. Attach
ends at center of strip together. Attach second
strip (60 lps) by pulling 2 lps of second
strip through 1 lp of first strip with crochet
hook, 1 lp of first through 2 lps of second,
until all loops are joined. Fasten end, and
sew center ends of strip together. Starting
each strip in a different place, join 3rd strip
(90 lps) by pulling 2 lps of second strip
through 3 lps of third, and 3 lps of third
through 2 lps of second, all around. Fasten.
Join fourth strip (90 lps) by pulling 3 lps
through 3 lps, all around. Fasten. Join 5th
strip (60 lps) by pulling 3 lps of fourth
through 2 lps of fifth, and 2 lps of fifth
through 3 lps of the fourth, all around. Fasten.</p>
<p>To finish last strip, pull 2 lps through 2 lps
all around. Fasten off. With J-10 crochet
hook and yarn used double, work around
edge of tam as follows: Work 45 sc around.
Join with a slip stitch. Work two more rows
of single crochet, stitch for stitch. Fasten off.
Make a large pom-pon with a Susan Bates or
Marcia Lynn pom-pon maker and attach to
top of tam.</p>
<p>SCARF: Make 4 strips each of 150 loops.
Lay two strips side by side on a table. Keep
in mind that each loop has two strands of
yarn but is still called a single loop. Put crochet
hook through first 2 lps on first strip.
Now put hook through first 2 lps on second
strip and pull them through the 2 lps already
on hook. With these 2 lps still on hook,
pick up the next 2 lps on first strip and pull
them through. Continue in this manner,
alternating first and second strips, until all
loops have been worked. Fasten off as shown
in basic directions. Join 3rd to 2nd and 4th
to 3rd strip in same manner as above. Finish
outside edges by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps
all the way to the top.</p>
<p>TO MAKE FRINGE. Wrap yarn around
a six-inch cardboard 96 times. Cut at one
end. Each piece should measure 12 inches.
Take 6 strands and fold them in half. Pull
folded end through work with crochet hook,
drawing it through about 2 inches. Then
pull the 12 loose ends through this loop, and
pull until knot is formed. Space them&mdash;2 at
each end of each strip, making 8 at each end.
Scarf may be made wider by adding more
strips.</p>

(to cover other half) until all rings have
been covered. Weave in end of yarn. Slip
ribbon in and out of each ring, leaving end
on each side long enough to make a bow.
Belt may be made longer or shorter by adding
or subtracting rings in multiples of two.
Always use an even number of rings.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Covered Buttons</h3>
<p>When making covered buttons, always use
the smallest crochet hook possible for the
yarn you are using. Work should be firm to
make a neat button. Also, the cover should
be a very tight fit. Lay yarn on table and
make a double loop. Pick loops up, and
insert crochet hook, and bring through a
loop from ball end of yarn. Ch 1 to secure
loop. Work 6 s c in loop. Pull short end until
hole is completely closed. Fasten this end
off.</p>
<p>Round 2: Work 2 s c in each s c around.</p>
<p>Round 3: * Work 1 s c in first s c, 2 s c in next
s c. Repeat from * around (18 s c). If you
are covering a larger button, continue to
increase 6 s c in each round until piece is
size of top of button.</p>

<p>Work one round even. Insert button mold
and work around in s c, decreasing 6 st each
round until mold is covered as much as possible.
Break off, leaving an eight-inch length
of yarn. Thread this on yarn needle and
weave around final edge, pulling in tightly.
Fasten off.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Button Rings</h3>
<p>With crochet hook, work as many s c around
plastic ring as needed to completely cover
ring. Break off, leaving a 10-inch strand of
yarn. Thread this strand on a yarn needle
and work in and out of every other stitch
around outside of ring. Carefully pull yarn
until all sts are turned to inside of ring.
Fasten off. On larger rings where one row
will not fill up center, work a second row
around, making a s c in every other stitch
before breaking off.</p>
<p>For a more decorative button, sew a rhinestone
or colored stone to center of button.</p>
